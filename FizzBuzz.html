<!-- The problem : Write a program that takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers from one to 
    the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of
     the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. 
    For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.-->


    <!-- The algortithm :
        
        1.When a user inputs a number
        2.Loop from 1 to the entered number
        3.If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
        4.If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
        5.If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
          Otherwise print the current number   -->
